# TSFSunSpotCountForecast
The quantity of sunspots visible on the surface of the Sun fluctuates annually. The Sun is most active during periods of sunspot maximums, emitting the greatest quantity of energy and radiation into the Earth's surroundings. As a result, during these maximum periods, there may be a surge in the Northern and Southern Lights, and radio transmissions and power grids may be disrupted. Consequently, it is crucial to monitor the count of sunspots.

Using the monthly average sunspot data available from 1749 to 2010, build a model to forecast the monthly average sunspot count for the period of 2011-2020
